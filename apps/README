------------------------------- HDL APPLICATIONS -------------------------------

Applications typically contain one or more templates, each of which contain one
or more platform specifications. The platform specifies the actual FPGA part to
be used, and the template specifies the pin assignments and the top-level HDL.

In addition to the template & platform specs, the actual application is a block
instantiated by the top-level HDL. In VHDL this is specified by a separate
harness.vhdl file, whereas in Verilog the application module must merely have
the correct name.
