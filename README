---------------- BUILD AND TEST HDL APPLICATIONS AND LIBRARIES -----------------

The hdlmake.py script automates the process of HDL validation, simulation and
synthesis. It works by reading simple YAML config files from your working dirs
and generating from them the files necessary to correctly invoke the
simulation and synthesis tools. It supports synthesis tools from Altera and
Xilinx, and simulation with GHDL and GTKWave. Support for Icarus Verilog and
ModelSim is planned.
